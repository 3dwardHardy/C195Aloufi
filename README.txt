How to run:
The login screen features a login button that allows login after entering a username and password.
The reset button clears the username and password entries.
The exit button closes the program.
There is also a language selection menu that allows the user to toggle French and English, though
the program will adjust language to the locale language upon launch. This menu allows a user to manually change that feature.
Upon logging in, the user is sent to home screen from here you may add and alter appointments, change the table
views, go to the customer menu, go to the report's menu, or Logout. The Customer menu option will take the user to a customer
menu where they can view the current customer data. The navigation options hera allow a user to add a customer, modify a
customer, or delete a customer record. The cancel button will return the user to the main screen.
Upon selection of the add customer button the user is taken to the add customer form and can save the customer,
clear the form or cancel to return to the customer menu.
The modify customer form has the same features utilized in the same way.
From the main screen a user can navigate to the report's menu by clicking the Report button.
This will open a menu with
buttons to select a specific report. The user simply clicks the type of report they wish to generate and then will be
navigated to that screen. Selecting the generate button will run the report after a user has made the appropriate selections.
This is done mostly via combo boxes. The type/ month report does require a number value to be input for
the month in order to generate.
 The cancel button will take the user back to the report menu.
From there they can hit the cancel button to go back to the main appointment view screen.

Additional Report: The additional report I included shows all appoints for a selected customer.
This is helpful in that if someone where to call asking when their next appointment was it is easy to find and view all
their appointments in the database.
